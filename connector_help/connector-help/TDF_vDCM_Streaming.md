## Configuration

### Connections

#### HTTP Connection

This connector uses an HTTP connection and requires the following input during element creation:

HTTP CONNECTION:

  - **IP address/host**: [The polling IP or URL of the destination.]
  - **IP port**: [The IP port of the destination. (default: *443*)]
  - **Device address**: [The bus address of the device. If the proxy server has to be bypassed, specify *BypassProxy*.]


### Initialization

In order for the element to work, the csv files (Grille.csv  and vDCM.csv) used to load the element tables must be placed in the protocol documents folder "C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents\TDF vDCM Streaming".
The user needs to set the device credentials in the General page.

### Web Interface

The web interface is only accessible when the client machine has network access to the product.

## How to use

The **General** page displays the credentials and the connection status of the element with the device. There is also a button to import the csv files.
The **DTOM** page displays the list of departments and the possibility to stop the Stream  and in the **v DCM** page the user can start and stop a particular stream.
